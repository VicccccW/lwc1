# LWC Learning Notes

## Basic

```Javascript
import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
```

> The Lightning Web Component model uses modules (built-in modules were introduced in ECMAScript 6) to bundle core functionality and make it accessible to the JavaScript in your component file. The core module for Lightning web components is `lwc`

```Javascript
import { LightningElement, track } from 'lwc';
```

> Bring in the module with the import statement and specify the functionality of the module that your component uses.
>
> In our example, the import statement indicates the JavaScript uses the LightningElement and track functionality from the lwc module.
